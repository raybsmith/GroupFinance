[TODO-GUI]
* Graphical interface to display current list of transactions.
  - Display total as sum of split if a non-"even" split
* For remove_person/debt_settled, first print total debt then
  confirm that the "reversing" transaction should be implemented.
* Add utility to do partial repayments -- implement this as
  an extra transaction having 2 people in transaction with payer
  not involved.
* Fix self.cur_names_listbox to not be selectable and also
  update_current_display_list for delete syntax.
* Add functionality to add transactions.
* Fix add_person after adding way to add transactions.

[TODO-Engine]
* Test function to print a person's total debt/assets right now.
* Test remove_person functionality.

[Optional]
* Set gui to always pass a list of people involved in a
  transaction and get rid of "ALL" as a possibility for "others".
  That's nice for CLI but useless for GUI, and CLI's not terribly
  practical for this.


[DONE]
* Fix adding transactions. They payer wasn't necessarily involved
  in the transaction.
* Move the transaction exceptions to the store_transaction
  function. This should really be taken care of then.
* Fix get_persons_total_debt to also return things required for
  the other remove_person options.
* In remove_person, add the option to "buy out". To do this, we
  really just need a function that gets a person's total debts,
  prints that amount. Then the leaver can pay (get paid by)
  a particular person
  who is the "debt_absorber" in the current implementation. But
  not quite, because I think "debt_absorber" is broken. They
  should absorb debts and assets.
* Fix remove_person to work with stored transactions rather than
  a stored payment matrix
